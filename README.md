# ðŸ‘—ðŸ‘œ Fashion-MNIST Image Classification Web App

This project is a web application that uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to classify clothing images from the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset of Tensorflow. The user interface is built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload an image and instantly receive prediction results. The dataset contains 60,000 grayscale 28Ã—28 images across 10 clothing categories. The ANN model was trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 256, achieving high accuracy on the test set. The app automatically resizes and converts any uploaded image to the 28Ã—28 grayscale format used during training.

## Sample Images

The `sample_images/` directory contains example images for all 10 classes. This allows recruiters or testers to quickly evaluate the app without sourcing their own images.  
To test:
1. Launch the web app.
2. Select an image from the `sample_images/` directory.
3. View prediction results instantly.
